# Open_Food_Facts_ML

### The Exploratory Data Analysis was done in the two ipynbs: Categorical.ipynb and Correlation.ipynb
### The AEC were made using the AEC.py script.
### Each model has its own script.
### Shap analysis was done using the Shap_analysis.ipynb.

#### For all the work, the data used can be extracted from Open Food Facts Database. We used CUDF to load the data considering the huge size of the data. We prefered to use GPU-accelerated libraries like cuML, LGBM, and pytorch.
